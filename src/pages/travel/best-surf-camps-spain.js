            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Northern Spain has been one of our favorite regions for a surf vacation for years. A surf vacation in Spain is often a bit overshadowed by the options in neighboring countries like France and Portugal, but that is certainly not always justified! Northern Spain offers a great number of ingredients that make your surf vacation unforgettable.

            <h2 className="text-4xl my-2">WHY SPAIN IS AN EXCELLENT DESTINATION FOR YOUR NEXT SURF CAMP</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Compared to France, Spain has a number of very interesting advantages. The surf conditions in Spain, especially for beginner surfers, are excellent. Several surf spots in Spain are known to be among the very best for beginners. The main reason for this is that the coast of northern Spain consists of countless different bays. These bays ensure that the surf spots of northern Spain are somewhat more sheltered than the surf spots of, for example, France, where the surf spots are more 'open' in relation to the Atlantic Ocean. The surf spots of Zarautz, Loredo and Somo, Oyambre, and San Vicente de la Barquera are examples of excellent locations for your next surf camp.
            </p>
  
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Moreover, the north of Spain offers stunning natural beauty. For example, in the Spanish region of Cantabria, the landscape is dominated by the overwhelming mountains of the Picos de Europa, which are located directly behind the coast of Spain. This means that you can literally surf with the snowy peaks of the Picos de Europa in the background. The Picos de Europa and several related mountain ranges are extremely rugged areas where bears and wolves live, among other wildlife.
            </p>
  
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Additionally, Spanish gastronomy is of an exceptionally high level. The northern Spanish region of the Basque Country, for example, has the highest concentration of Michelin-starred restaurants. But in Spain, you don't necessarily have to dine in a Michelin-starred restaurant to enjoy high-quality food. In many restaurants or caf√©s in places like Zarautz or San Sebastian, you can expect excellent food. Another advantage: the price/quality ratio is excellent in Spain. The costs of both accommodation and dining are generally much lower than the prices in the south of France.

            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Spain offers several excellent surf camps, each with its own unique character. An advantage of Spain is that it is possible to drive from the Netherlands or Belgium. For a limited number of surf accommodations, it is even possible to travel by bus during the summer months. Most surf camps in Spain are located in the two northern Spanish regions of the Basque Country and Cantabria.
